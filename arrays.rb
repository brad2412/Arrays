#Index position refers to the number that corresponds with an 
#element  and where it is located in the bracket. Index postion starts with 0

#For example "Josh" would be in index postion 0 or Name [0]
# and Chris would be 3 or Name [3]

#Shuffle! (Name.shuffle!) Would shuffle all the elements inside the name brackets.
